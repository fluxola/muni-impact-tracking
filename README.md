# muni-impact-tracker

...is a project that seeks to be able to track the impact of economic activity and spending on property values and revenue in a municipality.

Handcrafted with <3 in Windsor, VT.

Underlying data will be found in the data/ folder.

### EARLY DAYS and SHIFTING SANDS WARNING!

* This project is UNSTABLE.

Eventually, I aim to make this a useable public resource. For now, it's mostly an exercise in data crunching in python.
